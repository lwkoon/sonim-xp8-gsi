## Files the user supplies

These are proprietary and are never redistributed by this project:

- **The stock backup** of the user's own phone (`scripts/dump-stock.sh`). It
  supplies the Sonim kernel and ramdisk (`boot_a`), the Sonim and Qualcomm
  vendor files and libraries (`system_a`), `xtra-daemon`, `CACertService`,
  the fstab and the audio configuration. `scripts/assemble.sh` combines them
  with this project's components on the user's computer into `boot.img` and
  `vendor.img`, which stay with the user. Sonim has not published the source
  of its kernel.
- **The Sonim-signed firehose loader** `prog_emmc_ufs_firehose_Sdm660_ddr.elf`
  and **the AT&T Android 8.1 userdebug `abl.elf`**, downloaded by the user
  from the sources in the [install guide](docs/install.md#prerequisites).

## Release assets

- `system.img.xz` is built by CI from the inputs above and this
  repository's patches. It contains TrebleDroid, MindTheGapps and the phh IMS
  app, each under its own terms, and patched AOSP components (Apache-2.0).
- `xp8-gsi-components-<tag>.tar.xz` holds parts built from this repository
  (MIT): `libxp8shim.so`, the overlay APKs and the vibrator service, plus the
  AOSP Messaging app with this repository's manifest change (Apache-2.0).
